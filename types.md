# Token Types

Two token standards are expected, one for fungible tokens and one for non-fungible tokens. These are tentatively called `STORE-UTILITY` and `STORE-NFT` respectively.

## STORE-UTILITY

### Use-cases

STORE-UTILITY tokens have limitless use-cases as they are fully general purpose and programmable. These tokens may be used in financial applications such as for synthetic assets, equity tokens, utility tokens, social tokens, fractionalized ownership of non-fungible tokens, etc.

## Yield Generation

As these tokens are fully general purpose, whether they generate yield will depend entirely on their use-case. If they grant ownership to some financial asset, or access to some revenue stream, or payout in the case of some event, they may generate yield.

## STORE-NFT

### Use-cases

STORE-NFT are non-fungible and can be used to grant ownership of digital art/collectibles, gaming items, real world assets, or similar. They may be used to grant access/permission to a user for some app or service. STORE-NFT can also represent ownership of some financial contract like an insurance policy or liquidity provider position (similar to Uniswap V3 LP NFTs).

## Yield Generation

STORE-NFT are general purpose programmable tokens, so they may grant yield to the token holder if they represent ownership of some cash-flow or financial asset.

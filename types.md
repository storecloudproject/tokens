# Token Types

Two token standards are expected, one for fungible tokens and one for non-fungible tokens. These are tentatively called `STORE-UTILITY` and `STORE-NFT` respectively.

## Use-cases

These token types can be used for any use-case which developers choose.

Fungible tokens tend to be more common in decentralized finance applications, often used for synthetic assets, equity tokens, utility tokens, etc. Fungible tokens may also be used as social tokens, to represent fractionalized ownership of NFTs, etc.

Non-fungible tokens are more commonly used to represent digital art, gaming items, ownership of real-world assets like property, as well as certain financial instruments like insurance policies, liquidity provider positions, and so on.

## Yield Generation

Either token type can, in principle, generate yield for the holder. As both `STORE-UTILITY` and `STORE-NFT` are fully programmable, both can grant the holder ownership of some financial asset, access to some revenue stream, payout in the case of some event, etc.
